# Introduction

Capsaicin is the active component in chili peppers responsible for their characteristic heat. Extracting capsaicin from ghost peppers (Bhut Jolokia) using a Soxhlet extractor and anhydrous ethanol is an effective method to obtain a concentrated extract.

# Safety

- **Personal Protection**: Wear gloves, goggles, and a lab coat at all times. Wear mask when directly handling capsaicin-ethanol solution.
- **Ventilation**: Perform the extraction under a fume hood or in well ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes.
- **Ethanol**: Highly Flammable liquid and vapor. Causes serious eye irritation. (PubChem SDS)
- **Capsaicin**: Harmful if swallowed. Causes severe skin irritation. Causes serious eye damage. (PubChem SDS)

# Procedures
## Part A: Preparation

1. Ensure the ghost peppers are thoroughly dried and crush them into small pieces using a mortar and pestle or blender. Increased surface area improves extraction efficiency.
2. Place the crushed peppers into a cellulose extraction thimble. If a thimble is unavailable, place cotton balls at the bottom of the extractor chamber to prevent clogging of the siphon tube.
3. Assemble the Soxhlet extractor:
	1.  Attach the boiling flask to the Soxhlet extractor.
	2. Place the thimble containing the crushed ghost pepper into the main chamber of the Soxhlet extractor. If a thimble is unavailable, carefully the crushed ghost pepper on top of the cotton balls and place an extra two cotton balls on top.
	3. Connect the condenser on top of the extractor.
	4. Ensure the condenser is continuously supplied with cooled water.
	5. Secure all glassware with clamps and ensure airtight connections using joints or appropriate fittings.
## Part B: Extraction

1.  Pour enough anhydrous ethanol into the boiling flask to allow continuous extraction (roughly half the volume of the flask). Add a few boiling chips to the flask to prevent bumping during boiling.
2. Place the flask on the hot plate or in a water/oil bath. Gradually heat the ethanol to its boiling point (78.37Â°C).
    - **Extraction Cycle**:
        - As the ethanol boils, vapor rises into the condenser, cools, and drips onto the pepper material.
        - The solvent percolates through the material, dissolving capsaicin and other soluble compounds.
        - When the Soxhlet chamber fills to the siphon point, the solvent containing the dissolved compounds siphons back into the flask.
3. For this extraction, approximately 8-12 cycles is sufficient for an optimal yield. This corresponds to roughly 6-7 hours of continuous extraction. The color of the solvent in the siphon tube will gradually change from a deep red to a pale yellow. Once it has reached a pale yellow this indicates that most of the capsaicin has been extracted.
## Part C: Disassembly and Solvent Recovery

1. After the desired number of cycles, turn off the heat source and allow the apparatus to cool. Carefully disassemble the apparatus, starting from the top to prevent spills.
2. The ethanol in the round-bottom flask now contains the extracted capsaicin. If a rotary evaporator is available, use it to remove the ethanol.
3. If a rotary evaporator is unavailable, heat the solution to evaporate ethanol. Ethanol can be collected using a distillation apparatus if available. Note that ethanol collected using distillation may be contaminated.
4. Evaporate the solution until it reaches a viscous consistency.
5. Transfer the concentrated capsaicin extract to a glass vial, that is clearly labeled.

# Conclusions

## Yield

With an initial 25g of crushed ghost peppers, approximately 5mL of highly concentrated capsaicin was extracted over the course of 9 Soxhlet cycles spanning nearly 7 hours. Images of the extract can be seen in the images section.

## Non-Capsaicin Contaminants Extracted

Anhydrous ethanol is a polar solvent capable of dissolving various compounds present in ghost peppers. Alongside capsaicin, the following non-capsaicinoid contaminants were possibly co-extracted:
- Carotenoid pigments like capsanthin and capsorubin, responsible for the red color of peppers. 
- Flavonoid compounds such as quercetin and luteolin glycosides with antioxidant properties.
- Phenolic acids including caffeic acid and ferulic acid.

## Further Purification

To obtain higher purity, additional steps like liquid-liquid extraction, column chromatography, or recrystallization could be feasible. However, the yield of further purification is negligible, and likely not worth the time. Synthesis is a more viable route for obtaining pure capsaicin crystals.
